--- Because of my interdisciplinary training in psychology, educational measurement and data science, my primary focus of my current research is on the joint of educational psychometric measurement and data science. Concretely, I am interested in developing and applying novel computational methods (e.g., deep learning) to uncover and facilitate student learning based on the structured and unstructured data on students' interactions with digital learning environments. I am also interested in adapting data science techniques to address conventional psychometric measurement problems.
